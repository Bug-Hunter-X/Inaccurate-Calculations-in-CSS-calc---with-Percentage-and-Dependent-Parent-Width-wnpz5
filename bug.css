The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there is a subtle bug that arises when using `calc()` with percentages and other units. The issue is that if you are calculating a value based on the parent's width, and the parent's width depends on another element's width, there might be a timing issue causing an inaccurate calculation. The `calc()` function will evaluate the parent's width before the other dependent element is fully rendered, resulting in incorrect calculations and unexpected layout.
