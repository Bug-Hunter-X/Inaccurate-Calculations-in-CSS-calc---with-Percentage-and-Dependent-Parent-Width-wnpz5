One potential solution is to avoid relying on parent widths calculated from other elements. If possible, use viewport-based units like `vw` (viewport width) or `vh` (viewport height) instead. These units are calculated based on the viewport's size, avoiding the timing-related issues. Another approach might involve using JavaScript to detect when all elements are rendered and then performing the calculation. However, this introduces additional complexity and is generally less preferred.
