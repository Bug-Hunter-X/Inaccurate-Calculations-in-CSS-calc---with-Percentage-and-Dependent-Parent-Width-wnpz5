This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in CSS's `calc()` function when dealing with percentages and parent widths that depend on other elements. The bug occurs because of timing issues during page rendering. The `calc()` function calculates the value before all dependent elements' widths are fully determined, leading to unexpected layout issues. The solution demonstrates a workaround using the `vw` unit to solve the problem in some scenarios.
